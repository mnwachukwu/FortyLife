# Introduction

In my frustration one night, I decided that I've had enough of the shoddy free services that allow you to manage a Magic: The Gathering collection and it really cheesed me off to pick and pay for one specific provider that didn't have all the features that I would have wanted in a collection application. Instead of settling for one, I decided I would create one. It would have all of the bells and whistles - the best features - from all of the sites I've used and leave out all of the bad things from these sites. I then thought, I have a lot of Magic: The Gathering playing friends who also write code so I wanted to open source the effort.

This is the project for that vision. I have purchased the domain forty.life and some hosting to use for the release version of this project. Of course, anyone is free to take the project for themselves and modify it, redistribute it, or host their own instance. This code is being worked on to provide a free service, so I only ask that derivative be offered non-commercially. Honestly, the commercialization of such a service is understandable, but half of the reason I developed Forty Life was in spite of that so at the very least I can promise that Forty Life will remain free of charge.
